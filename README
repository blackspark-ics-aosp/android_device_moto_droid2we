On behalf of the entire DX/D2/D2G/DPRO community, I wish to extend my sincere
thanks to the CyanogenDefy team for their continuing efforts on the code side
of most things.  They've always been the ones to go out of their way to make
shit work in a way moto never imagined on their supposely "locked" hardware.

My hat's off to you, and everyone else who has put their own time and resources
into bettering the Android experience on oft-neglected hardware.
